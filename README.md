Everyone is building “agent systems” like they’re factories: more orchestration, more control, more supervisors, more brittle guarantees. That only works for orgs with massive capital, deep domain expertise, and the patience to fight their own harness.

Shoreline treats frontier models as an ocean: massively energetic, coherent over long horizons when the context is rich, and unavoidably fallible. You don’t try to eliminate hallucination; you assume error, harvest the variation it creates, and let selection pressure do the work. Tests matter, but not as a purity ritual: they’re split and graduated—some visible as documentation and attractors, some withheld as real evolutionary pressure—because you need both learning and discrimination. Fractal hinting is the nutrient field: comments, docs, CLI help, and tests layered across scales so the system stays latched, and even its inevitable mistakes orbit the same invariants.

The point of Shoreline is the barrier. Not a boss, not a workflow diagram—a boundary across which life forms. On one side: the open ocean of generation and drift. On the other: stable land where knowledge can fossilize into tissue. Barriers are habitats with controlled porosity: user and developer viewpoints, different powers, different horizons, bug reports crossing the fence. When work survives the gates, it joins main as living structure. When it doesn’t, it doesn’t vanish—it collects on the wrack line, tagged and legible, becoming driftwood for future constraints, witnesses, and hints.

Stop trying to control the ocean. Build a shoreline that makes the right things wash up, take root, and stay.
